h|*Description*
2+a|Model of a transition in the Instruction State Machine, caused by a careflow step. The attributes document the careflow step as well as the ISM transition.

^h|*Signature*
^h|*Meaning*

h|*0..1*
|*transition*: `<<_order_execution_transition_enumeration,Order_execution_transition>>`
a|The ISM transition which occurred to arrive in the current_state. Coded by openEHR terminology group  Instruction transitions.

h|*0..1*
|*careflow_step*: `link:/releases/BASE/{base_release}/foundation_types.html#_terminology_term_class[Terminology_term^]`
a|The step in the careflow process which occurred as part of generating this action, e.g.  dispense ,  start_administration. This attribute represents the clinical  label for the activity, as  opposed to current_state which represents  the state machine (ISM)  computable form. Defined in archetype.

h|*1..1*
|*current_state*: `<<_order_execution_state_enumeration,Order_execution_state>>`
a|The ISM current state. Coded by openEHR terminology group Instruction states.

h|*0..1*
|*reason*: `List<link:/releases/BASE/{base_release}/data_types.html#_text_class[Text^]>`
a|Optional possibility of adding one or more reasons for this careflow step having been taken. Multiple reasons may occur in medication management for example.
