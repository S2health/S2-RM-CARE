h|*Description*
2+a|Any kind of observation made by indirect means, i.e. determined from raw data or samples of the subject by some process.

The `_result_time_` property records when the result was available, while the inherited `_time_` property records the sample time, which is the time at which the reported result values were true.

If not populated, value is assumed to be the same as `_time_`.
