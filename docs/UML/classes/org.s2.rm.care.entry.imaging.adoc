h|*Description*
2+a|Category of observation in which results are determined by an interpretation of raw imaging or EKG data.

The interpretation may be carried out by human, rule-based, generative AI or other means. The intial data capture is considered the 'observation time', i.e. `Observation_single._time_`.

Generally there is a time lag between capture and interpretation, although this may be reduced by technical means.
