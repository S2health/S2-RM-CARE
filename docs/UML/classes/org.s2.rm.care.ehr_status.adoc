h|*Class*
2+^h|*Ehr_status*

h|*Description*
2+a|Single object per EHR containing various EHR-wide status flags and settings, including whether this EHR can be queried, modified etc. This object is always modifiable, in order to change the status of the EHR as a whole.

NOTE: It is strongly recommended that the inherited attribute `_uid_` be populated in `EHR_STATUS` objects, using the UID copied from the `_object_id()_` of the `_uid_` field of the enclosing `VERSION` object. +
For example, the `ORIGINAL_VERSION.uid` `87284370-2D4B-4e3d-A3F3-F303D2F4F34B::uk.nhs.ehr1::2`  would be copied to the `_uid_` field of the `EHR_STATUS` object.

a|True if this EHR should be included in population queries, i.e. if this EHR is considered active in the population.

h|*1..1*
|*is_modifiable*: `link:/releases/BASE/{base_release}/base.html#_boolean_class[Boolean^]`
a|True if the EHR, other than the `EHR_STATUS` object, is allowed to be written to. The `EHR_STATUS` object itself can always be written to.
